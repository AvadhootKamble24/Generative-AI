      "of Open AI. Open AI. Open AI. Reshaping   industries. Dude's a straightup tech lord. Let's \n",
      "be honest. Right now, they're trying to build a   super intelligence that could far exceed humans \n",
      "in almost every field. And they just released   their most powerful model yet. Just a couple years \n",
      "ago, that would have sounded like science fiction.   Not anymore. In fact, they're not alone. We are \n",
      "in the middle of the highest stakes global race   any of us have ever seen. Hundreds of billions of \n",

      "he's trying to build to see what it looks   like so that you and I can really understand \n",
      "what's coming. Welcome to Huge Conversations. How are you? Great to meet you. Thanks for \n",
      "doing this. Absolutely. So, before we dive in,   I'd love to tell you my goal here. Okay. I'm \n",
      "not going to ask you about valuation or AI   talent wars or fundraising or anything like that. \n",
      "I think that's all very well covered elsewhere. It   does seem like it. Our big goal on this show is to \n",
      "cover how we can use science and tech to make the   future better. And the reason that we do all of \n",
      "that is because we really believe that if people   see those better futures, they can then help \n",
      "build them. So, my goal here is to try my best   to time travel with you into different moments \n",
      "in the future that you're trying to build and see   what it looks like. Fantastic. Awesome. Starting \n",
      "with what you just announced, you recently said,   surprisingly recently, that GPT4 was the dumbest \n",
      "model any of us will ever have to use again.   But GPT4 can already perform better than 90% of \n",
      "humans at the SAT and the LSAT and the GRE and it   can pass coding exams and sommelier exams and medical \n",
      "licensing. And now you just launched GPT5. What   can GPT5 do that GPT4 can't? First of all, one \n",
      "important takeaway is you can have an AI system   that can do all those amazing things you just \n",
      "said. And it doesn't it clearly does not replicate   a lot of what humans are good at doing, which I \n",
      "think says something about the value of SAT tests   or whatever else. But I think had you gone back \n",
      "to if we were having this conversation the day of   GPT4 launch and we told you how GPT4 did at those \n",
      "things, you were like, \"Oh man, this is going to   have huge impacts and some negative impacts on \n",
      "what it means for a bunch of jobs or you know   what people are going to do.\" And you know, this \n",
      "is a bunch of positive impacts that you might have   predicted that haven't yet come true. Uh, and so \n",
      "there there's something about the way that these   models are good that does not capture a lot of \n",
      "other things that we need people to to do or care   about people doing. And I suspect that same thing \n",
      "is going to happen again with GPT5. People are   going to be blown away by what it does. Uh, it's \n",
      "really good at a lot of things and then they will   find that they want it to do even more. Um, people \n",
      "will use it for all sorts of incredible things.   uh it will transform a lot of knowledge work, \n",
      "a lot of the way we learn, a lot of the way we   create um but we people society will co-eolve with \n",
      "it to expect more with you know better tools. So   yeah like I think this model is quite remarkable \n",
      "in many ways quite limited in others but the fact   that for you know 3 minute 5 minute 1-hour tasks \n",
      "that uh like an expert in a in a field could maybe   do or maybe struggle with that the fact that you \n",
      "have in your pocket one piece of software that   can do all of these things is really amazing. \n",
      "I think this is like unprecedented at any point   in human history that I that a technology has \n",
      "improved this much this fast and and the fact   that we have this tool now, you know, we're like \n",
      "living through it and we're kind of adjusting step   by step. But if we could go back in time five or \n",
      "10 years and say this thing was coming, we would   be like probably not. Let's assume that people \n",
      "haven't seen the headlines. What are the topline   specific things that you're excited about? and \n",
      "also the things that you seem to be caveatting,   the things that maybe you won't expect it to do. \n",
      "Um, the thing that I am most excited about is this   is a model for the first time where I feel like I \n",
      "can ask kind of any hard scientific or technical   question and get a pretty good answer. And I'll \n",
      "give a fun example actually. Uh when I was in   junior high uh or maybe it was nth grade, \n",
      "I got a TI83, this old graphing calculator,   and I spent so long making this game called Snake. \n",
      "Yeah. Uh it was very popular game with kids in my   school. And I was I was like uh I was like pro and \n",
      "it was dumb, but it was like programming on TID3   was extremely painful and took a long time and \n",
      "it was really hard to like debug and whatever.   And on a whim with an early copy of GPT5, I was \n",
      "like, I wonder if it can make a TI83 style Game   of Snake. And of course, it did that perfectly \n",
      "in like 7 seconds. And then I was like, okay,   am I supposed to be would my like 11-year-old \n",
      "self think this was cool or like, you know,   miss something from the process? And I \n",
      "had like 3 seconds of wondering like, oh,   is this good or bad? And then I immediately said, \n",
      "actually, now I'm missing this game. I have this   idea for a crazy new feature. Let me type it \n",
      "in. it implements it and it just the game live   updates and I'm like actually I'd like it to look \n",
      "this way. Actually, I'd like to do this thing and   I had this like this very like kind of you have \n",
      "this experience that reminded me of being like 11   in programming again where I was just like I now I \n",
      "want to try this now I have this idea now I but I   could do it so fast and I could like express ideas \n",
      "and try things and play with things in such real   time. I was like, \"Oh man, you know, I was worried \n",
      "for a second about kids like missing the struggle   of learning to program in this sort of stone age \n",
      "way.\" And now I'm just thrilled for them because   the the way that people will be able to create \n",
      "with these new tools, the speed with which you   can sort of bring ideas to life, you know, in \n",
      "that's that's pretty amazing. So this idea that   GPT5 can just not only like answer all these hard \n",
      "questions for you but really create like ondemand   almost instantaneous software that's I think \n",
      "that's going to be one of the defining elements   of the GPD5 era in a way that did not exist with \n",
      "GPD4. As you're talking about that I find myself   thinking about a concept in weightlifting of time \n",
      "under tension. Yeah. And for those who don't know   it's you can squat 100 pounds in 3 seconds or you \n",
      "can squat 100 pounds in 30. You gain a lot more   by squatting it in 30. And when I think about our \n",
      "creative process and when I've felt most like I've   done my best work, it has required an enormous \n",
      "amount of cognitive time under tension. And I   think that that cognitive time under tension \n",
      "is so important. And it's it's ironic almost   because these tools have taken enormous cognitive \n",
      "time under tension to develop. But in some ways I   do think people might say they're you people are \n",
      "using them as a escape hatch for thinking in some   ways maybe. Now you might say yeah but we did that \n",
      "with the calculator and we just moved on to harder   math problems. Do you feel like there's something \n",
      "different happening here? How do you think about   this? It's different with I mean there are some \n",
      "people who are clearly using chachine not to   think and there are some people who are using \n",
      "it to think more than they ever have before.   I am hopeful that we will be able to build the \n",
      "tool in a way that encourages more people to   stretch their brain with it a little more and \n",
      "be able to do more. And I think that like you   know society is a competitive place like if you \n",
      "give people new tools uh in theory maybe people   just work less but in practice it seems like \n",
      "people work ever harder and the expectations of   people just go up. So my my guess is that like \n",
      "other tools uh some people like other pieces   of technology some people will do more and some \n",
      "people will do less but certainly for the people   who want to use chatbt to increase their cognitive \n",
      "time under tension they are really able to and it   is I take a lot of inspiration from what like the \n",
      "top 5% of most engaged users do with chacht like   it's really amazing how much people are learning \n",
      "and doing and you know outputting. So my I've   only had GPT5 for a couple hours so I've been \n",
      "playing. What do you think so far? I'm I'm just   learning how to interact with it. I mean part of \n",
      "the interesting thing is I feel like I just caught   up on how to use GPT4 and now I'm trying to learn \n",
      "how to use GPD5. I'm curious what the specific   tasks that you found most interesting are because \n",
      "I imagine you've been using it for a while now.   I I have been most impressed by the coding tasks. \n",
      "I mean, there's a lot of other things it's really   good at, but this this idea of the AI can write \n",
      "software for anything. And that means that you   can express ideas in new ways that the AI can \n",
      "do very advanced things. It can do, you know,   it can like in some sense you could like ask \n",
      "GPT4 anything, but because GPT5 is so good at   programming, it feels like it can do anything. Of \n",
      "course, it can't do things in the physical world,   but it can get a computer to do very complex \n",
      "things. And software is this super powerful,   you know, way to like control some stuff and \n",
      "actually do some things. So, that that for me   has been the most striking. Um, it's gotten it's \n",
      "much better at writing. So, this is like there's   this whole thing of AI slop like AI writes in this \n",
      "kind of like quite annoying way and M dashes. M we   still have the M dashes in GPT5. A lot of people \n",
      "like them dashes, but the writing quality of GPT5   is gotten much better. We still have a long way \n",
      "to go. We want to improve it more, but like uh   I've a thing we've heard a lot from people inside \n",
      "of OpenAI is that man, they started using GPT5,   they knew it was better on all the metrics, but \n",
      "there's this like nuance quality they can't quite   articulate, but then when they have to go back \n",
      "to GPT4 to test something, it feels terrible.   And I I don't know exactly what the cause \n",
      "of that is, but I suspect part of it is the   writing feels so much more natural and better. \n",
      "I in preparation for this interview reached out   to a couple other leaders in AI and technology \n",
      "and gathered a couple questions for you. Okay,   so this next question is from Stripe CEO Patrick \n",
      "Collison. This will be a good one. Read this   verbatim. It's about the next stage. What what \n",
      "comes after GBT5? In which year do you think a   large language model will make a significant \n",
      "scientific discovery and what's missing such   that it hasn't happened yet? He caveed here that \n",
      "we should leave math and special case models like   alpha fold aside. He's specifically asking about \n",
      "fully general purpose models like the GPT series.   I would say most people will agree that that \n",
      "happens at some point over the next two years.   But the definition of significant matters a lot. \n",
      "And so some people significant might happen,   you know, in early 25. Some people might maybe \n",
      "not until late 2026. Sorry, early 2026. Maybe some   people not until late 2027, but I would I would \n",
      "bet that by late 27, most people agree that there   has been an AIdriven significant new discovery. \n",
      "And the thing that I think is missing is just   the kind of cognitive power of these models. \n",
      "A framework that one of the researchers said   to me that I really liked is, you know, a year \n",
      "ago we could do well on like a high school like   a basic high school math competition problems that \n",
      "might take a professional mathematician seconds to   a few minutes. We very recently got an IMO gold \n",
      "medal. That is a crazy difficult like could you   explain what that means? That's kind of like the \n",
      "hardest competition math test. This is something   that like the very very top slice of the world. \n",
      "many many professional mathematicians wouldn't   solve a single problem and we scored at the top \n",
      "level. Now there are some humans that got an even   higher score in the gold medal range but we we \n",
      "like this is a crazy accomplishment and these   each of these problems it's like six problems over \n",
      "9 hours so hour and a half per problem for a great   mathematician. So we've gone from a few seconds \n",
      "to a few minutes to an hour and a half maybe to   prove a significant new mathematical theorem is \n",
      "like a thousand hours of work for a top person   in the world. So we've got to go from, you know, \n",
      "another significant gain. But if you look at our   trajectory, you can say like, okay, we're getting \n",
      "to that. We have a path to get to that time   horizon. We just need to keep scaling the models. \n",
      "The long-term future that you've described is   super intelligence. What does that actually mean? \n",
      "And how will we know when we've hit it? If we had   a system that could do better research, better AI \n",
      "research than uh say the whole open AI research   team, like if we were willing, if we said, \"Okay, \n",
      "the best way we can use our GPUs is to let this AI   decide what experiments we should run smarter than \n",
      "like the whole brain trust of Open AAI.\" Yeah. And   if that same to make a personal example, if that \n",
      "same system could do a better job running open AI   than I could. So you have something that's like, \n",
      "you know, better than the best researchers, better   than me at this, better than other people at their \n",
      "jobs, that would feel like super intelligence to   me. That is a sentence that would have sounded \n",
      "like science fiction just a couple years ago.   And now it kind of does, but it's you can like see \n",
      "it through the fog. Yes. And so one of the steps   it sounds like you're saying on that path is this \n",
      "moment of scientific discovery of asking better   questions of grappling with things in a in a way \n",
      "that expert level humans do to come up with new   discoveries. One of the things that keeps knocking \n",
      "around in my head is if we were in 1899 say and   we were able to give it all of physics up until \n",
      "that point and play it out a little bit. Nothing   further than that. Like at what point would one \n",
      "of these systems come up with general relativity?   Interesting question is did you like if we think \n",
      "about that forward like like if we think of where   we are now should a if if we never got another \n",
      "piece of physics data. Yeah. Do we expect that a   really good super intelligence could just think \n",
      "super hard about our existing data and maybe   say like solve high energy physics with no new \n",
      "particle accelerator or does it need to build a   new one and design new experiments? Obviously \n",
      "we don't know the answer to that. Different   people have different speculation. Uh but I \n",
      "suspect we will find that for a lot of science,   it's not enough to just think harder about data we \n",
      "have, but we will need to build new instruments,   conduct new experiments, and that will take some \n",
      "time. Like that that is the real world is slow   and messy and you know whatever. So I'm sure we \n",
      "could make some more progress just by thinking   harder about the current scientific data we \n",
      "have in the world. But my guess is to make   the big progress we'll also need to build new \n",
      "machines and run new experiments and there will   be some slowdown built into that. Another way of \n",
      "of thinking about this is AI systems now are just   incredibly good at answering almost any question. \n",
      "But maybe one of the things we're saying is it's   another leap yet. And what Patrick's question \n",
      "is getting at is to ask the better questions.   Or or if we go back to this kind of timeline \n",
      "question, we could maybe say that AI systems   are superhuman on one minute tasks, but a long \n",
      "way to go to the thousand hour tasks. And there's   a dimension of human intelligence that seems \n",
      "very different than AI systems when it comes   to these long horizon tasks. Now, I think we will \n",
      "figure it out, but today it's a real weak point.   We've talked about where we are now with GBC5. \n",
      "We talked about the end goal or future goal of   super intelligence. One of the questions that \n",
      "I have, of course, is what does it look like   to walk through the fog between the two. The next \n",
      "question is from Nvidia CEO Jensen Hong. I'm going   to read this verbatim. Fact is what is. Truth is \n",
      "what it means. So facts are objective. Truths are   personal. They depend on perspective, culture, \n",
      "values, beliefs, context. One AI can learn and   know the facts. But how does one AI know the \n",
      "truth for everyone in every country and every   background? I'm going to accept as axioms those \n",
      "definitions. I'm not sure if I agree with them,   but in the issues of time, I will just take them. \n",
      "I will take those definitions and go with it. Um, I have been surprised, I think many other people \n",
      "have been surprised too about how fluent AI is   at adapting to different cultural contexts and \n",
      "individuals. One of my favorite features that we   have ever launched in chatbt is the the sort of \n",
      "enhanced memory that came out earlier this year.   like it really feels like my Chad GBT gets to \n",
      "know me and what I care about and like my life   experiences and background and the things that \n",
      "have led me to where they are. A friend of mine   recently who's been a huge CHBT user, so he's \n",
      "got a lot of a a lot of he's put a lot of his   life into all these conversations. He gave his \n",
      "Chad GBT a bunch of personality tests and asked   them to answer as if they were him and it got \n",
      "the same scores he actually got, even though   he'd never really talked about his personality. \n",
      "And my ChachiBD has really learned over the years   of me talking to it about my culture, my \n",
      "values, my life. And I have used, you know,   I sometimes will use it in like uh I'll use like \n",
      "a free account just to see what it's like without   any of my history and it feels really really \n",
      "different. So I think we've all been surprised on   the upside of how good AI is at learning this and \n",
      "adapting. And so do you envision in many different   parts of the world people using different \n",
      "AIs with different sort of cultural norms and   contexts? Is that what we're saying? I think that \n",
      "everyone will use like the same fundamental model,   but there will be context provided to that model \n",
      "that will make it behave in sort of personalized   way they want their community wants. Whatever. \n",
      "I think when we're getting at this idea of facts   and truth and uh it brings me to this seems like a \n",
      "good moment for our first time travel trip. Okay,   we're going to 2030. This is a serious question, \n",
      "but I want to ask it with a light-hearted example.   Have you seen the bunnies that are jumping on \n",
      "the trampoline? Yes. So, for those who haven't   seen it, maybe it looks like backyard footage of \n",
      "bunnies enjoying jumping on a trampoline. And this   has gone incredibly viral recently. There's a \n",
      "humanmade song about it. It's a whole thing.   There were a trampoline. And I think the reason \n",
      "why people reacted so strongly to it, it was maybe   the first time people saw a video, enjoyed it, \n",
      "and then later found out that it was completely AI   generated. In this time travel trip, if we imagine \n",
      "in 2030, we are teenagers and we're scrolling   whatever teenagers are scrolling in 2030. How do \n",
      "we figure out what's real and what's not real?   I mean, I can give all sorts of literal answers \n",

      "My understanding is that there are three big   categories that have been limiting factors for \n",

      "is often a limiting factor piece of this and all   the other components together. This is hugely \n",
      "complex and expensive. And we are we're still   doing this in like a sort of bespoke one-off way \n",
      "although it's getting better. Like eventually we   will just design a whole kind of like mega factory \n",
      "that takes you know I mean spiritually it will be   melting sand on one end and putting out fully \n",
      "built AI compute on the other but we are a long   way to go from that and it's a it's an enormously \n",
      "complex and expensive process. uh we are putting   a huge amount of work into building out as much \n",

      "to serve it and it's going to be like those early   GPD4 days and the world just wants much more AI \n",

      "That's actually this is what I expect to turn   the majority of my attention to is how we build \n",

      "millions and eventually hopefully billions of GPUs   that are sort of in service of what people want \n",
      "to do with this. When you're thinking about it,   what are the big challenges here in this category \n",

      "limited by the processing chips and the memory   chips uh how you package these all together how \n",
      "you build the racks and then there's like a list   of other things that are you know there's like \n",

      "this once we get some of those robots built,   they can help us automate it even more. But just, \n",
      "you know, like a world where you can basically   pour in money and get out a pre-built data center. \n",
      "Uh so that'll be that'll be a huge unlock if we   can get it to work. Second category, data. Yeah, \n",
      "these models have gotten so smart. There was a   time when we could just feed it another physics \n",
      "textbook and got a little bit smarter at physics,   but now like honestly GBT5 understands \n",
      "everything in a physics textbook pretty well.   We're excited about synthetic data. We're very \n",
      "excited about our users helping us create harder   and harder tasks and environments to go off and \n",
      "have the system solve. But uh I think we're data   will always be important, but we're entering a \n",
      "realm where the models need to learn things that   don't exist in any data set yet. They have to \n",
      "go discover new things. So that's like a crazy   new How do you teach a model to discover new \n",
      "things? Well, humans can do it. like we can   go off and come up with hypotheses and test them \n",
      "and get experimental results and update on what we   learn. So probably the same kind of way. And then \n",
      "there's algorithmic design. Yeah, we've made huge   progress on algorithmic design. Uh the thing that \n",
      "the thing that I think open does best in the world   is we have built this culture of repeated and big \n",
      "algorithmic research gains. So we kind of you know   figured out the what became the GPT paradigm. We \n",
      "figured out became the reasoning paradigm. We're   working on some new ones now. Um, but it is very \n",
      "exciting to me to think that there are still many   more orders of magnitudes of algorithmic \n",
      "gains ahead of us. We we just yesterday   uh released a model called GPOSS, open source \n",
      "model. It's a model that is as smart as 04 Mini,   which is a very smart model that runs locally on \n",
      "a laptop. And this blows my mind. Yeah. Like if   you had asked me a few years ago when we'd have \n",
      "a model of that intelligence running on a laptop,   I would have said many many years in the future. \n",
      "But then we we found some algorithmic gains   um particularly around reasoning but also some \n",
      "other things that let us do a a tiny model that   can do this amazing thing. And you know those are \n",
      "those are the most fun things. That's like kind of   the coolest part of the job. I can see you really \n",
      "enjoying thinking about this. I'm curious for   people who don't quite know what you're talking \n",
      "about, who aren't familiar with how an algorithmic   design would lead to a better experience that they \n",
      "actually use. Could you summarize the state of   things right now? Like what what is it that you're \n",
      "thinking about when you're thinking about how fun   this problem is? Let me start back in history \n",
      "and then I'll get to some things for today. So,   GPT1 was an idea at the time that was quite \n",
      "mocked by a lot of experts in the field,   which was can we train a model to play a little \n",
      "game, which is show it a bunch of words and have   it guess the one that comes next in the sequence. \n",
      "That's called unsupervised learning. There's not   you're not really saying like this is a cat, \n",
      "this is a dog. You're saying here's some words,   guess the next one. And the fact that that can \n",
      "go learn these very complicated concepts that   can go learn all the stuff about physics and math \n",
      "and programming and keep predicting the word that   comes next and next and next and next seemed \n",
      "ludicrous, magical, unlikely to work. Like how   was that all going to get encoded? And yet humans \n",
      "do it. you know, babies start hearing language and   figure out what it means kind of largely uh or at \n",
      "least to some significant degree on their own. And   and so we did it and then we also realized that if \n",
      "we scaled it up, it got better and better, but we   had to scale over many many orders of magnitude. \n",
      "So it wasn't that good in the GPT1 day. It wasn't   good at all in the GPT1 days. And a lot of experts \n",
      "in the field said, \"Oh, this is ridiculous. It's   never going to work. It's not going to be robust.\" \n",
      "But we had these things called scaling laws. And   we said, \"Okay, so this gets predictably better as \n",
      "we increase compute, memory, data, whatever. And   we can we can decide we can use those predictions \n",
      "to make decisions about how to scale this up and   do it and get great results.\" And that has worked \n",
      "over Yeah. a crazy number of orders of magnitude.   And it was so not obvious at the time. like \n",
      "that was that was I think the the reason the   world was so surprised is that that seemed like \n",
      "such an unlikely finding. Another one was that we   could use these language models with reinforcement \n",
      "learning where we're saying this is good, this is   bad to teach it how to reason. And this led to the \n",
      "01 and 03 and now the GBT5 progress. And that that   was another thing that felt like uh if it works \n",
      "it's really great but like no way this is going   to work. It's too simple. And now we're on to new \n",
      "things. We've figured out how to make much better   video models. We are we are discovering new ways \n",
      "to use new kinds of data and environment to kind   of scale that up as well. Um and I think again \n",
      "you know 5 10 years out that's too hard to say in   this field but the next couple of years we have \n",
      "very smooth very strong scaling in front of us.   I think it has become a sort of public narrative \n",
      "that we are on this smooth path from one to two to   three to four to five to more. Yeah. But it also \n",
      "is true behind the scenes that it's a it's not   linear like that. It's messier. Tell us a little \n",
      "bit about the mess before GPT5. What was what were   the interesting problems that you needed to solve? \n",
      "Um, we did a model called Orion that we released   as GPT 4.5. And we had we did too big of a \n",
      "model. It was just it was it's a very cool model,   but it's unwieldly to use. And we realized that \n",
      "for kind of some of the research we need to do on   top of a model, we need a different shape. So we \n",
      "we followed one scaling law that kept being good   without without really internalizing. There was \n",
      "a new even steeper scaling law that we got better   returns for compute on, which was this reasoning \n",
      "thing. So that was like one alley we went down and   turned around, but that's fine. That's part of \n",
      "research. Um, we had some problems with the way   we think about our data sets as these models like \n",
      "really have to get get this big and um, you know,   learn from this much data. So So yeah, I think \n",
      "like in the in the middle of it in the day-to-day,   you kind of you make a lot of U-turns as \n",
      "you try things or you have an architecture   idea that doesn't work, but the the aggregate the \n",
      "summation of all the squiggles has been remarkably   smooth on the exponential. One of the \n",
      "things I always find interesting is that   by the time I'm sitting here interviewing \n",
      "you about the thing that you just put out,   you're thinking about Exactly. What are the things \n",
      "that you can share that are at least the problems   that you're thinking about that I would be \n",
      "interviewing you about in a year if I came back? I mean, possibly you'll be asking me like, \n",
      "what does it mean that this thing can go   discover new science? Yeah. What how how \n",
      "is the world supposed to think about GPT6   discovering new science? Now, maybe \n",
      "not like maybe we don't deliver that,   but it feels within grasp. If you did, what \n",
      "would you say? What would your what would the   implications of that kind of achievement \n",
      "be? Imagine you do succeed. Yeah. I mean,   I think the great parts will be great. the bad \n",
      "parts will be scary and the bizarre parts will   be like bizarre on the first day and then we'll \n",
      "get used to them really fast. So we'll be like,   \"Oh, it's incredible that this is like being \n",
      "used to cure disease and be like, oh, it's   extremely scary that models like this are being \n",
      "used to like create new biocurity threats.\" And   then we'll also be like, man, it's really weird \n",
      "to like live through watching the world speed up   so much and you know the economy grows so fast \n",

      "best thing ever. I know you just had your first   kid. How does what you just said affect how I \n",

      "go to college you might there there are a couple   of things that you've said so far that feed into \n",

      "in a world that you envision and therefore they   will have more more ability to say I want to build \n",
      "this here's the superpowered tool that will help   me do that or yeah like I want my kid to think \n",
      "I had a terrible constrained life and that he   has this incredible infinite canvas of stuff to \n",
      "do that that that is like the way of the world.   We've said that uh 2035 is a little bit too far in \n",
      "the future to think about. So maybe this this was   going to be a jump to 2040 but maybe it will keep \n",
      "it shorter than that. When I think about the area   where AI could have for both our kids and us the \n",
      "biggest genuinely positive impact on all of us,   it's health. So if we are in pick your year, call \n",
      "it 2035 and I'm sitting here and I'm interviewing   the dean of Stanford medicine, what do you hope \n",
      "that he's telling me AI is doing for our health   in 2035? Start with 2025. Okay. Um yeah, please. \n",
      "One of the things we are most proud of with GPT5   is how much better it's gotten at health advice. \n",

      "do. Um, yeah, and better healthcare is wonderful,   but obviously what people actually want \n",

      "plague us. I think that'll be one of the most   viscerally felt benefits of of AI. People talk a \n",

      "Based on the transcript, society should prepare for AI-driven rapid changes by:  \n",
      "1. **Emphasizing adaptability**: The transcript highlights that humanity has historically adapted to rapid change, suggesting continuous learning and flexibility will be critical.  \n",
      "2. **Re-evaluating resource access**: There is speculation that societies may need to discuss how to share AI's benefits equitably, particularly making AI compute \"abundant and cheap\" to avoid concentration of power or misuse.  \n",
      "3. **Building on collective infrastructure**: Recognizing society as a \"super intelligence\" formed by layered contributions (technical, social, political), preparation should involve maintaining and improving shared systems that enable AI advancements.  \n",
      "4. **Addressing psychological and practical shifts**: People will struggle with the \"vertigo\" of accelerated change, implying mental readiness and societal norms to process rapid technological evolution.  \n",
