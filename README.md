# üöÄ My Generative AI Learning Hub

A repository documenting my journey, projects, and experiments in the fascinating world of Generative AI. This space serves as a personal log of my learning path, from foundational concepts to building real-world applications.

## üéØ About This Repository

This repository is my personal chronicle as I dive deep into Generative AI. It contains a collection of my notes, code implementations from tutorials, mini-projects, and eventually, larger, more complex applications. The goal is to create a structured library of my work, tracking my progress and solidifying my understanding of this transformative technology.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Getting Started

To run any of the projects in this repository, follow these general steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Navigate to a specific project folder:**
    ```bash
    cd 03_Projects/project-name/
    ```

3.  **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**
    *(It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment)*
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  Follow the instructions in the project's specific `README.md` file.
