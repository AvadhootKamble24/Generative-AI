# 🚀 My Generative AI Learning Hub

A repository documenting my journey, projects, and experiments in the fascinating world of Generative AI. This space serves as a personal log of my learning path, from foundational concepts to building real-world applications.

## 🎯 About This Repository

This repository is my personal chronicle as I dive deep into Generative AI. It contains a collection of my notes, code implementations from tutorials, mini-projects, and eventually, larger, more complex applications. The goal is to create a structured library of my work, tracking my progress and solidifying my understanding of this transformative technology.

## 📂 Repository Structure
Of course. It looks like the text isn't being treated as pre-formatted, causing the alignment to break.

To fix this and make it look like a proper directory tree, you need to wrap the entire structure inside a **markdown code block**. This tells the markdown renderer to preserve all the spaces and characters exactly as you typed them.

### Corrected Code Block

Copy the entire block below (including the triple backticks \`\`\` at the start and end) and paste it into your `README.md` file.

```markdown
```

.
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
└── Research\_Paper\_Summarizer/
├── prompt\_generator.py
└── prompt\_ui.py

```
```

This will render as a clean, properly aligned directory structure, like this:

```
.
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
└── Research_Paper_Summarizer/
    ├── prompt_generator.py
    └── prompt_ui.py
```
## 🧠 Key Areas of Focus

While the field is vast, my current learning is focused on the following areas:

* **Large Language Models (LLMs):** Understanding and utilizing models like GPT, Llama, and Mistral.
* **Prompt Engineering:** The art and science of crafting effective prompts.
* **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Building chatbots and Q&A systems on custom data.
* **Fine-Tuning:** Adapting pre-trained models for specific tasks and domains.
* **Image Generation:** Exploring diffusion models like Stable Diffusion.
* **Vector Databases:** Working with tools like ChromaDB, Pinecone, and FAISS for efficient data retrieval.
* **AI Agents:** Building autonomous agents that can reason and use tools.

## ▶️ Getting Started

To run any of the projects in this repository, follow these general steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Navigate to a specific project folder:**
    ```bash
    cd 03_Projects/project-name/
    ```

3.  **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**
    *(It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment)*
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  Follow the instructions in the project's specific `README.md` file.
